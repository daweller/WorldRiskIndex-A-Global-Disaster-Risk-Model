# The WorldRiskIndex
by Daniel Weller

The WorldRiskIndex is a measure of the risk of countries being affected by humanitarian disasters as a result of extreme natural events such as storms, earthquakes, droughts or floods. The methodology was originally developed by the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) on behalf of Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft. Since 2018, the WorldRiskIndex has been calculated by the Institute for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict (IFHV) at the Ruhr-University Bochum and its methodology has been continuously developed to increase the number of countries included in the analysis and to allow for an annual update of exposure and vulnerability data (see Radtke & Weller 2019). As these changes to the methodology proposed by Birkmann et al. (2011) affected the comparability of the most recent data with previously published results, complete time series data of all raw indicators and aggregated results were produced by applying the revised methodology of Radtke & Weller (2019) to historical time series from 2011 to 2021:

Please note that a new methodology for the calculation of the WorldRiskIndex will be published in September 2022, which will replace the current modelling. After this date, no further updates will be provided for the calculation of the WorldRiskIndex according to Birkmann et al. (2011) and Radtke & Weller (2019).
